# Keras RetinaNet [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fizyr/keras-retinanet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fizyr/keras-retinanet) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/100249425.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/100249425)

Keras implementation of RetinaNet object detection as described in [Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002)
by Tsung-Yi Lin, Priya Goyal, Ross Girshick, Kaiming He and Piotr Dollár.

## Installation

1) Clone this repository.
2) Ensure numpy is installed using `pip install numpy --user`
3) In the repository, execute `pip install . --user`.
   Note that due to inconsistencies with how `tensorflow` should be installed,
   this package does not define a dependency on `tensorflow` as it will try to install that (which at least on Arch Linux results in an incorrect installation).
   Please make sure `tensorflow` is installed as per your systems requirements.
4) Alternatively, you can run the code directly from the cloned  repository, however you need to run `python setup.py build_ext --inplace` to compile Cython code first.
5) Optionally, install `pycocotools` if you want to train / test on the MS COCO dataset by running `pip install --user git+https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git#subdirectory=PythonAPI`.


## Training
`keras-retinanet` can be trained using [this](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet/blob/master/keras_retinanet/bin/train.py) script.
Note that the train script uses relative imports since it is inside the `keras_retinanet` package.
If you want to adjust the script for your own use outside of this repository,
you will need to switch it to use absolute imports.

If you installed `keras-retinanet` correctly, the train script will be installed as `retinanet-train`.
However, if you make local modifications to the `keras-retinanet` repository, you should run the script directly from the repository.
That will ensure that your local changes will be used by the train script.

The default backbone is `resnet50`. You can change this using the `--backbone=xxx` argument in the running script.
`xxx` can be one of the backbones in resnet models (`resnet50`, `resnet101`, `resnet152`), mobilenet models (`mobilenet128_1.0`, `mobilenet128_0.75`, `mobilenet160_1.0`, etc), densenet models or vgg models. The different options are defined by each model in their corresponding python scripts (`resnet.py`, `mobilenet.py`, etc).

Trained models can't be used directly for inference. To convert a trained model to an inference model, check [here](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet#converting-a-training-model-to-inference-model).

### Usage
For training, run:
```shell
# Running directly from the repository:
keras_retinanet/bin/train.py pascal /path/to/VOCdevkit/VOC2007

# Using the installed script:
retinanet-train pascal /path/to/VOCdevkit/VOC2007
```
