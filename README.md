# Power-Plant-Detection-in-RSI


Introduction
---
In this repository, we try to use deep learning method to detect power plants in remote sensing images. We provide a dataset which 
contains 892 remote sensing images. We also offer eight deep learning models which contain Faster R-CNN, R-FCN, FPN, DCN, SSD, DSSD, YOLO and RetinaNet.

Dataset
---
Our dataset which is collected from Google Earth covers 60 fossil fuel power plants in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region. We divide the 
dataset into four classes i.e. working chimney, unworking chimney, working condensing tower and unworking condensing tower. The format of 
annotations and label are pascal VOC2007. You can download the dataset at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1PGY_Z96xr0ZlWRmuAtTR-A and the 
password is v3x1.
